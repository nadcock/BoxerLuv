# BoxerLuv

BoxerLuv is a mobile app designed for the Boxer rescue organization of the same name (http://www.boxerluv.org/). It enables the user to view a list of current dogs available from the rescue. The list provides basic information on the dog and a thumbnail image. Tapping on a dog in the list will take the user to a detail page where the user can see a larger description, more pictures (when these are available), and can favorite a dog for easier searching later on. The user can also tap on the image carousel to see the dogs pictures in full screen. There is a separate table view that lists all the user's favorited dogs, and a tab with more information about the rescue. The dogs will persist offline using Core Data (Note: only the thumbnail image is persisted in the database, all other images are downloaded when accessed to help keep the app lightweight).
